## Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Swarms for Large-Scale, Real-Time, and Intelligent Disaster Responses

<img src="figures/image.jpg" width="400">

## Introduction
The aim of this project is to develop and test a swarm of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that is capable of monitoring air pollution emitted by wildfires and to understand the effects of the pollution on human health. An octocopter UAV, equipped with a customized air quality sensor package and a volatile organic compound (VOC) air sampler has been developed and successfully tested during several prescribed fires conducted by the *California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection* ([CAL FIRE](https://www.fire.ca.gov/)).
